Furthermore, through analysis of fundraising goals of existing plays, this project conveys successful goal targets for this campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
First, a pivot table is created from the Kickstarter sheet to determine the time of the year that is most suitable for starting a campaign. This pivot table is filtered to show data for parent category “theater”. The total number of successful, failed, and canceled campaign outcomes are added for all the years since the campaigns started and further categorized by months of the year in rows. /resources/Theater_Outcome_vs_Pivot_Table.png
