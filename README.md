# Kickstarter-Project

## Overview of Project
The playwright, Louise wants to kickstart her theater production using crowdfunding campaign. This analysis gains insights from existing Kickstarter dataset to determine factors that were critical in making a campaign successful.  The existing dataset is organized, analyzed, and visualized in microsoft excel to communicate relevant findings to Louise.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine if Louise's fundraising campaign will succeed, fail, or get canceled based on the time of the year when the campaign is launched.  Furthermore, through analysis of fundraising goals of existing plays, this project conveys successful goal targets for this campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
First, a pivot table is created from the Kickstarter sheet to determine the time of the year that is most suitable for starting a campaign. This pivot table is filtered to show data for parent category “theater”. The total number of successful, failed, and canceled campaign outcomes are added for all the years since the campaigns started and further categorized by months of the year in rows.

A line graph is created from this table to show the general trend for successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. Kickstarter-Project/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outcomes based on goals is performed by first categorizing projects based on their goal amount. These categories define different dollar amount ranges sorted in ascending order. The total number of successful, failed, and canceled projects are shown in these categories as numbers as well as percentages. The percentages are further plotted in a line graph to show a general trend. Kickstarter-Project/resources/Outcomes_vs_goals.png
